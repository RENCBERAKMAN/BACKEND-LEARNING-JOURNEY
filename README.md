# Backend Journey for a Website

This project was created to build the backend system for a website I'm developing, step by step.  
So far, I’ve set up the core structure using Express.js — including the route, controller, service, and model layers.  
MongoDB integration is complete, JSON responses have been tested, and API endpoints for displaying user data have been defined.

This project is part of my learning process as I explore how to build backend systems and gradually move toward a more modular structure.  
My goal is to work with advanced architectures like microservices, and strengthen my technical foundation as I continue learning.

## 🧰 Technologies Usedd

- Node.js & Express.js  
- MongoDB & Mongoose  
- Postman  
- VS Code  
- Git & GitHub  

---

## 🔧 Current Structure

- Express server is up and running  
- `/user` route serves test endpoints  
- File structure is organized as: `route → controller → service → model`  
- MongoDB connection is set up and data flow has been tested

## 🗺️ Planned Improvements

- Full user system (create, read, delete)  
- JWT-based login and role-based access  
- Middleware for input validation and error handling  
- Pagination, filtering, and sorting systems  
- Microservice-ready modules: user, auth, blog, etc.  
- Logging, error reporting, and testing setup  
- Deployment setup and use of `.env` files

## 📝 Note

This project is part of my backend learning journey.  
I’m progressing on my own, aiming to build systems through both architectural and technical understanding.  
Every step is tracked through GitHub, and I'm building a structure that could eventually support larger, more complex projects.
